# Active Context: OpenProductWiki

## Current Focus
**Initial Memory Bank Setup**: Establishing comprehensive documentation structure for the OpenProductWiki project based on analysis of the existing codebase.

## Recent Analysis
- **Project Structure**: Analyzed full-stack Next.js + FastAPI architecture
- **Feature Set**: Identified core functionality including multi-provider AI integration, RAG-powered Q&A, and visual diagram generation
- **Technical Stack**: Documented Next.js 15.3.1 frontend with FastAPI backend and multiple AI provider support
- **Configuration System**: Found flexible JSON-based configuration for models, embeddings, and repository processing

## Current State Assessment
The project appears to be a mature, feature-complete implementation with:
- ✅ **Multi-Provider AI Support**: Google Gemini, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Azure OpenAI, Ollama
- ✅ **Private Repository Access**: Token-based authentication for GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket
- ✅ **RAG Implementation**: Vector database with FAISS for repository Q&A
- ✅ **Visual Diagrams**: Mermaid.js integration for architecture visualization
- ✅ **Internationalization**: Multi-language support with next-intl
- ✅ **Docker Deployment**: Complete containerization with docker-compose
- ✅ **Streaming Interface**: Real-time progress updates via WebSocket

## Active Decisions Made
1. **Memory Bank Structure**: Implemented complete memory bank following the standard pattern with core files and tasks directory
2. **Documentation Approach**: Created comprehensive technical documentation covering architecture, patterns, and context
3. **Project Classification**: Identified as a production-ready AI-powered documentation generation platform

## Next Steps Priority
1. **Identify Current Issues**: Review any existing bugs, performance bottlenecks, or missing features
2. **Enhancement Opportunities**: Look for areas where the system could be improved or extended
3. **User Experience**: Evaluate the current user interface and interaction patterns
4. **Performance Analysis**: Check for optimization opportunities in the generation pipeline
5. **Testing Coverage**: Assess current testing infrastructure and coverage

## Key Questions to Explore
- Are there any specific pain points or issues in the current implementation?
- What features or improvements are most needed?
- How is the system performing with different repository sizes and types?
- Are there any security or scalability concerns?
- What user feedback patterns have emerged?

## Technology Context
- **Frontend**: Modern React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and streaming UI updates
- **Backend**: FastAPI with WebSocket support for real-time communication
- **AI Integration**: Sophisticated provider abstraction supporting 5 different AI services
- **Data Pipeline**: Efficient repository processing with caching and vector storage
- **Deployment**: Production-ready Docker setup with volume persistence

## Immediate Priorities
1. Complete memory bank initialization
2. Identify any outstanding tasks or issues
3. Understand current development priorities
4. Assess system health and performance
5. Document any recent changes or ongoing work

This represents a solid foundation for a production AI documentation platform with room for continued enhancement and optimization based on user needs and technical improvements.
