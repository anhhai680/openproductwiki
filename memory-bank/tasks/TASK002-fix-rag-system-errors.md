# [TASK002] - Fix RAG System FAISS Retriever Errors

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-09-30  
**Updated:** 2025-09-30

## Original Request
Identified critical FAISS retriever assertion errors affecting the RAG system functionality during memory bank update review.

## Thought Process
The logs show FAISS retriever errors with assertion failures in the search operation:
```
AssertionError: assert d == self.d
```

This indicates a dimension mismatch between the query vectors and the indexed vectors in FAISS. The error occurs in the `retrieve_string_queries` method, suggesting that:

1. **Embedding Dimension Mismatch**: The query embeddings have different dimensions than the stored index
2. **Index Corruption**: The FAISS index might be corrupted or incompatible
3. **Model Configuration**: Different embedding models might be used for indexing vs. querying
4. **Initialization Issues**: The retriever might not be properly initialized with consistent parameters

This is a critical issue because it prevents the Q&A feature from working, which is a core functionality of the system.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Investigate FAISS retriever configuration and initialization
- [ ] Check embedding model consistency between indexing and querying
- [ ] Verify vector dimensions in stored indexes
- [ ] Implement better error handling and validation
- [ ] Add dimension checking before FAISS operations
- [ ] Test with fresh embeddings to rule out corruption
- [ ] Document proper FAISS configuration requirements

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 10%

## Progress Log
### 2025-09-30
- Identified FAISS retriever assertion errors in application logs
- Error occurs in `faiss_retriever.py` line 294 during search operation
- AssertionError suggests dimension mismatch between query and index vectors
- System currently falling back with "No documents retrieved from RAG" warnings
- Need to investigate embedding configuration and model consistency
- This is blocking the Q&A functionality which is a core feature

## Technical Context
- **Error Location**: `/opt/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/adalflow/components/retriever/faiss_retriever.py`
- **Error Type**: AssertionError in FAISS search operation
- **Impact**: Q&A feature returns no context, degraded user experience
- **Frequency**: Consistent error pattern in recent logs
- **Related Config**: `api/config/embedder.json` configuration file
