# Product Context: OpenProductWiki

## Problem Statement
Most software repositories lack comprehensive, up-to-date documentation. Developers spend significant time trying to understand codebases, especially when:
- Joining new teams or projects
- Working with legacy systems
- Exploring open-source projects
- Maintaining complex architectures

Traditional documentation approaches fail because:
- Manual documentation becomes outdated quickly
- Writing comprehensive docs is time-consuming
- Understanding code relationships requires deep analysis
- Onboarding new developers takes too long

## Solution Overview
OpenProductWiki automatically analyzes any repository and generates:
1. **Structured Documentation**: Comprehensive wiki pages explaining code organization
2. **Visual Diagrams**: Mermaid charts showing architecture, data flow, and component relationships
3. **Interactive Q&A**: RAG-powered chat interface for repository-specific questions
4. **Deep Research**: Multi-turn AI investigation for complex technical topics

## User Experience Goals

### Primary User Journey
1. **Input**: User enters a repository URL (public or private)
2. **Authentication**: For private repos, user provides access tokens
3. **Configuration**: User selects AI model provider and generation options
4. **Processing**: System clones, analyzes, and generates documentation with real-time progress
5. **Interaction**: User explores generated wiki and asks questions via chat interface

### Key Experience Principles
- **Simplicity**: One-click documentation generation
- **Transparency**: Clear progress indicators and error messages
- **Flexibility**: Multiple AI providers and customization options
- **Security**: Safe handling of private repository credentials
- **Performance**: Fast generation even for large repositories

## Target Use Cases

### Developer Onboarding
- New team members quickly understand project structure
- Visual diagrams explain system architecture
- Q&A feature answers specific implementation questions

### Code Exploration
- Open-source contributors explore unfamiliar projects
- Researchers analyze project patterns and approaches
- Developers evaluate libraries and frameworks

### Documentation Maintenance
- Teams generate fresh documentation after major changes
- Technical writers understand codebases they're documenting
- Project maintainers provide better contributor documentation

### Enterprise Documentation
- Large organizations document internal repositories
- Custom AI endpoints for sensitive codebases
- Batch processing for multiple repositories

## Success Indicators
- **Speed**: Wiki generation completes in under 60 seconds for typical repositories
- **Quality**: Generated documentation accurately reflects code structure and relationships
- **Usability**: Users can navigate and understand documentation without additional training
- **Accuracy**: Q&A feature provides correct, contextually relevant answers
- **Adoption**: Users return to generate documentation for multiple repositories

## User Feedback Integration
The system should adapt based on:
- Wiki quality feedback (thumbs up/down on generated content)
- Common question patterns in Q&A interactions
- Repository types that perform better/worse
- User preferences for diagram types and detail levels

This product serves the fundamental need for accessible, accurate, and current technical documentation in the software development ecosystem.
