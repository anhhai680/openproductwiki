## Current Status (What's Working)

### Performance Metrics
- **Generation Speed**: Typical repositories generate wikis in under 60 seconds
- **Memory Efficiency**: FAISS CPU implementation handles large repositories
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple wikis can be generated simultaneously
- **Cache Effectiveness**: Subsequent generations are significantly faster

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear repository input and configuration options
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress indicators and streaming status updates
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions

### Data Pipeline
- **Repository Cloning**: Reliable cloning of public and private repositories
- **Code Analysis**: Effective extraction of code structure and relationships
- **Embedding Generation**: Successful vector representation of repository content
- **Documentation Generation**: High-quality wiki content with proper formatting

## Known Issues (Areas for Improvement)

### Performance Considerations
- **Large Repository Handling**: Very large repositories (>100MB) may timeout
- **Memory Usage**: Peak memory usage during embedding generation
- **Concurrent Limits**: No explicit rate limiting for multiple simultaneous requests

### User Experience Gaps
- **Progress Granularity**: Limited detailed progress information during generation
- **Error Recovery**: Manual retry required for failed generations
- **History Management**: No built-in wiki version history or change tracking

### Feature Completeness
- **Batch Processing**: No support for processing multiple repositories at once
- **API Documentation**: Limited automated API endpoint documentation
- **Testing Framework**: Minimal automated testing coverage
